# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

Tic Tac Toe is a fun and interactive browser-based implementation of the classic game! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows two players to take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
